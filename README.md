#### **Important Notes:**
- The version deployed at the above link is an **older version** of the application.
- We are currently unable to deploy the updated version of the application due to network issues and resource connectivity problems with the Azure cloud environment.

#### **Challenges with Deployment:**
- The existing Azure resources are not connecting properly, and we are unable to perform incremental updates or fixes.
- Redeploying the updated version would require creating new instances and services from scratch, which is a time-intensive process.
- Given the limited time available before submission, we are focusing on ensuring the updated application runs successfully in the **local environment**.

#### **Current Status:**
- The latest version of the application, with all bug fixes and updates, is fully functional when run locally.
- We aim to demonstrate the updated functionality using the local environment while maintaining the older version for reference in the cloud.

This approach ensures that all project requirements are met within the given constraints.
